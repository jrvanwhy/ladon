A friend of mine and I put together some *really basic* ideas about a new programming language.
The goals of the language would be similar to Python (high level, easy to code in, good for quick prototyping)
but it would be much more static than dynamic in order to avoid some of the pitfalls of Python's dynamicism
and provide better parse/compile-time checking.
